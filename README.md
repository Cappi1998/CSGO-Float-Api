# Getting Started

Setup is super easy, you just need to configure the `appsettings.json` file.

After you put the server online, you just need to access the admin panel through the browser and add your steam accounts easily and quickly.

ATTENTION: remembering that accounts must have CSGO to be able to use the gamecordenator. (it doesn't have to be csgo prime, it can be free)
